# ecmarkup language service

## VSCode

The [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=magicworks.ecmarkup) provides rich language support for the [ecmarkup language](https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup).

## Roadmap

- Read biblio from CDN
- Read biblio from workspace
- Refactor codebase with "project" that stores symbol information
  - Improve current features for local-defined syntaxes and AOs
  <!-- - Support emu-import -->

<!-- Currently this library does not do real analysis because the compiler of the [ecmarkup language](https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup) and the [grammarkdown language](https://github.com/rbuckton/grammarkdown) do not designed for IDE cases. -->

<!-- I cannot do too much things before we have real analysis https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#languageFeatures -->
